31 Day Challenge from GrowthHungry
I want to learn new things about Programming. In 31 Days I believe, that I can achieve basic level in Java language. Also that is the best way to improve time menegment and self-discipline.\
For about two month I wanted to start learning, but day by day only thing that I did - procrastinated. Thank you GrowthHungry for this challenge.
